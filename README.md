<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

# Here are some features of Donation Campaign Project

- On homepage, showing all donation category cards dynamically by data fetched from API.
- When a user clicks on a card on the homepage, it will navigate them to the donation details page, where they can see detailed information about the selected donation card.
- After the user clicking the "Donate" button within the donation details page, the selected card will be added to the donation page. User can see the list of previously added donated cards on his donation page.
- When a user enters a search category name in the search bar on the home page, he will only see category cards that match his search input.
- This project includes an error page that is displayed to users when a page cannot be found, providing a user-friendly experience in such situations.
